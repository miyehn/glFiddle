### glFiddle

An OpenGL playground.

For real-time rendering, check out [grass-sim](https://github.com/miyehn/glFiddle/tree/grass-sim) branch. This branch is not very interesting.

For offline stuff, I recently worked on a CPU pathtracer (multi-threaded of course). Sort of rebuilt [Scotty3D](https://github.com/cmu462/Scotty3D)'s pathtracer part from scratch. See `src/Pathtracer`
